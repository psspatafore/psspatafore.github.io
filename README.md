## Websites I Recommend
* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) - While I don't recommend using it for school papers, except to find sources listed on the site, I still find it fun to use casually and to get lost in.
* [Discord](https://discord.com/) - Discord is a website (and app) that allows its users to talk to millions of people across various communities. I've made a ton of online friends using it and made countless memories.
